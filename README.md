# google-weeb-loops
A collection of almost all PausePlay's Google logos.

Since Userstyles.org's servers are super damn slow I decided that putting these styles on GH will be a good idea.
Please be aware some of these are a little bit broken, not sure how to fix that atm.
# Setup
To use these styles in your web browser, use a browser extension called "Stylus".

[Download for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)</br>
[Download for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)

After downloading the following extension, go to google.com and then click on the Stylus extension icon.
You'll see a popup, click on "Write style for google.com" and paste in the CSS of your choice from the repository.
Hit "Save" and you're done.
